# Facial-Landmark-Detection
This is an implementation of Task Constrained Convolution Neural Network (TCDCN) which detects 5 landmarks (Both eyes, nose and both ends of lips) on a facial picture. Our model take in a list of directory location of images and produces images with marked landmark in the output directory.
